      <h3>The Problem</h3>

      <p>Never before have so many patients required translation in the Norwegian healthcare system. Labor immigrants, refugees and immigrants without sufficient understanding of the Norwegian language are increasing. 4.1% of the norwegian population comes from a refugee background, this accounts for 30% of all immigrants. The refugee crisis we have experienced in recent years has resulted in many refugees facing a healthcare system they are unable to communicate with. This vulnerable group in our society is dependent on building relations with a healthcare system they can rely on, and that can safeguard and understand their needs. In all groups we also find people with disabilities and illiterates, or people with a limited understanding of their native language. Today's solutions do not address the needs of these groups, as they require translation tools that are universally designed and culture-sensitive.
</p>

      <p>
Language barriers are a well known problem in the Norwegian health system. Patients that have a limited understanding of Norwegian or English do not get the information they have a right to know. Interpreters with sufficient competence can be unavailable, and often have a fair distance to travel. The current solutions for translation between patient and health professionals are complicated, time consuming and may cause confusion in situation where information can be a matter of life and death. Part of everyday life for health professionals is to meet people with different language backgrounds and from other cultures. Language barriers and lack of cultural competence can affect the patient's confidence in the healthcare system. <b>The importance of tools to ensure reliable communication has never been greater</b>.
      </p>

      <p class="floatLeftParagraph">

Today, we have solutions that work to some degree, but are unnecessarily complicated. Misconceptions and confusion can easily occur. “Pekeark” (see illustration), one of today's most used solutions, can be thick booklets with columns full of questions, statements and icons in both Norwegian and the patient's preferred language. They are often made specifically to each hospital by the enthusiasts in the healthcare system. The translations are often from Google translate and may therefore become misleading when accurate communication is key. This is cumbersome and outdated. It also takes longer than necessary to flip through all the sheets to find the right questions, especially when lack of time is generally a problem in the healthcare system.

      <p class="floatLeftParagraph">Google Translate is often used, but has been known as a unreliable translator for many years. In some situations it might be vital to find the correct information. Google Translate may have problems with similar words, and important details may get lost in translation. This emphasizes the importance of pre-produced and good translations made by professionals.<p>


      <p class="floatLeftParagraph">Anyone living in Norway is entitled to the necessary health care, cf. the Act relating to patients' rights [Pasient og brukerrettighetsloven]  Of 02.07.1999, § 2-1a. If you need an interpreter you are also entitled to this, cf. § 3-2. The problem is that many people do not get enough information about their rights. There are some who do not understand that they need or have the right to get an interpreter. The result is that many meet the healthcare system unable to communicate.</p>
      <p class="floatLeftParagraph">The Norwegian Tolketjenesten (Interpreter services) is very good, and Oslo University Hospital primarily want a medical interpreter to be used, so the patient can receive the best treatment. The solution we will present later will mainly l be used when an interpreter is en route, or otherwise not available.  </p>


      <p class="floatLeftParagraph">One of the problems that Oslo University Hospital focuses on is misunderstandings. Often they experience the patient and health professional believing they have understood each other, but then it appears at a later time that they have perceived different messages. Information about medical tests, new appointments and visitation times is lost. It is important that these details do not get lost in translation.
        Today's solution is inadequate and old-fashioned. The application we are going to present will help the health service in difficult situations, and ensure that patients receive the help and information they are entitled to.

        <h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>
      </div>

      <p>The communication application “Omsorg” is our solution to the language and cultural problem in Norwegian healthcare. In cooperation with counselor Maja G. Kielland at Oslo University Hospital, we have prototyped an application that can break the language barriers. The application is a communication tool that helps health professionals with simple instant translations in different situations at the hospital. A stylish and clean design reflects the general feel of the hospital, and building on principles of universal design makes the application accessible to all.</p>

      <p>We have made an interactive prototype of our application. Today the prototype supports Arabic and Norwegian. If we complete the development, it will initially support 10 different languages. All statements and questions in the application will be translated in advance by professional translators. This minimizes the likelihood of misunderstandings. The application should also contain information about medical tests and events related to the individual patient. Information about meals and visiting hours at the relevant department should also be available to the patient in their native language.
</p>

        <h2>ABOUT THE APPLICATION</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Throughout the development process, we have been focused on creating a product that anyone can use. Universal design and contrasting colours have been important. Our application has a high-contrast setting, which can be selected in the hamburger menu. This will make all colors change to yellow, white and black. We are also working on developing a mode for the visually impaired. The idea is that health professionals asks yes or no questions, these are translated by the app, and the patient gives thumbs up for yes or thumb down for no. This ensures that the visually impaired get equal access to the application. The application should read everything out loud, if  the "auto sound" setting is on. If this is off, things will be read out loud when you press the audio icon, which can be found on all categories and questions.</p>
      <p>We also take cultural sensitivity into account. When Arabic, which is read from right to left, is chosen as a language, the application becomes “mirrored”. Our solution has full right-to-left support. We have taken great care to make the icons in our application easily understandable and recognizable. </p>
      <h3>Module 1 - Communication</h3>

      <p class="floatLeftParagraph">It is our recommendation to try the application yourself to get a clear outlook on how it works. Please remember it is a prototype, and not all functions are operational now. All functional buttons will light up if the user clicks anywhere that is without a function.
        The communication module is the core of the application. The module is built to achieve two way communication between patient and healthcare professional. Both patient and healthcare professional can select statements and questions. Who begins the conversation is controlled by the button on top. If the button is set to the doctor icon, a question could be e.g. “are you thirsty?”.  On the other hand, if the button is set to the patient icon it could be something like “I am thirsty”. A conversation can then evolve based on the starting question.

  </div>
  <p class="floatLeftParagraph">The application will always ask the patient if they understand at the end of the conversation. Then both healthcare professional and patient will have a conformation that everything is understood. This helps build understanding and trust between patient and healthcare professional. </p>
  <h3 class="floatLeftParagraph">Module 2 – Events</h3>
  <p class="floatLeftParagraph">The “Events” module is made to be specific for each patient. Here you can find the patient’s next events, which might be a test or a visit from a specialist. The patient will also have access to information such as visiting hours and what room they are living in. This enables the patient to inform friends and family about how and when they can visit . You can also see meals served at the hospital, save food preferences and choose breakfast and evening meals.</p>
  <p class="floatLeftParagraph">To save this information a health professional must log into the application and choose the bedpost the patient is assigned to. All patients who require translation will be registered as a user while staying at the hospital. On this user ID, they can register their room number, bedpost and food preferences. Preferences like allergies, halal or vegan. When a health professional is logged in, future notifications and events they create will be saved to the related patient.</p>

        <h2>USER TESTING</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        Throughout the entire development process, the application has been user tested. Multiple students have tested the application during development and given valuable feedback. Maja from The Oslo University Hospital has tested the application and given feedback based on her expectations as well. Frequent communication with our client have been very useful for the development of this project.
      </p>
      <p>A user test was also performed on three nursing students. They will be the main user group of our product, and are thus very relevant to test the application on. The feedback was great, and they recognized the application as a tool that was in large demand within health care. Some had already experienced language barriers themselves and told us such a tool would have been helpful. Most of them found the user interface easy to navigate and found the application relatively intuitive. Some experienced problems when trying to understand the login process on module 2, and we used that feedback to make necessary changes to the application.</p>

        <h2>WEBDESIGN</h2>
      </div>
      <p>The users preferred platform should not affect how accessible the information on our website is. Therefore, there is a lot of work put into making the website user friendly for computer screens, mobile phones and tablets alike. The site is responsive and works just as well on all platforms. The site uses JavaScript, but is not dependent on it. That is just for a better user experience. </p>
      <p>The site is functional in all popular browsers (Chrome, FireFox, Edge and Internet Explorer). Accessibility and user friendliness have been a major focus when designing the website. Many people use the keyboard to browse the Internet because of preference or sickness, so a navigation function using tab was added. This is useful for quickly and easily browsing the entire website.  </p>
